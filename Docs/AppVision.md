## 🧭 Vision Statement

**SimpleCalorie** is a clean, trustworthy food and macro tracker built for people who want to stay on track without the chaos of typical calorie apps.  
It removes overwhelm and manipulative upsells, replacing them with calm clarity and simple motivation.

> “If you ate like this every day, you’d weigh X in Y weeks.”

That single projection captures the heart of the app: **awareness that feels empowering, not punishing.**

## 🌱 Purpose

Most fitness apps treat nutrition tracking as a chore. They overload users with micro-details, lock basic features behind subscriptions, and manipulate emotion through gamified streaks or guilt-based notifications.  
**SimpleCalorie** is different. It’s for people who value **clarity, control, and honesty.**

This app will help users:
- Build awareness of what they eat.
- Make decisions confidently based on reality, not guilt.
- Stay consistent because the app *feels light* to use.

- Begin low-fidelity wireframes in Figma (`/Design/Wireframes.fig`).  
- Research available open food databases (USDA, Edamam, OpenFoodFacts).  
- Set up Apple Health integration scaffolding.
