v0 slice:

A) Minimal use cases (v0.1)
	1.	Log a meal quickly (search)

	•	As a user, I want to type a food name, pick a result, set a portion, and save in ≤5s.
	•	Acceptance: From “Today,” user taps “+”, types “chicken”, selects, hits “Add”, totals update, success toast appears.

	2.	See today’s calories & projection

	•	As a user, I want to instantly see calories vs goal and a simple weight projection.
	•	Acceptance: “Today” shows consumed / goal and the sentence: “If you ate like this every day, you’d weigh X in Y weeks.” Both update after logging.

	3.	Quick add calories when food isn’t found

	•	As a user, I want to enter just calories (optionally macros) and save fast.
	•	Acceptance: From “+”, choose “Quick Add,” enter calories, save → totals update.
