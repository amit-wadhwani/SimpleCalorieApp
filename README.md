# SimpleCalorieApp

### Overview
A clean, encouraging food and macro tracker that focuses on *simplicity, clarity, and motivation* — not clutter or paywalls.  
At the end of each day, users see a clear projection:  
> “If you ate like this every day, you’d weigh X in Y weeks.”

### Vision
To help people eat consciously and track calories without friction — a **trust-first** alternative to MyFitnessPal and Lose It.

### MVP Scope
- Log foods via search, barcode, or quick add.
- See calories and macros (protein, carbs, fats + sugar, net carbs, sat fat).
- Simple daily goal + progress projection.
- Reuse past meals with one tap.
- (Later) AI photo recognition for quick logging.

### Differentiators
- **Simplicity:** Focus on clarity, not overload.
- **Motivation:** Daily projection instead of badges.
- **Trust:** Transparent pricing, no aggressive upsells.
- **Speed:** One-tap reuse and clean UI.
